    "\n",
    "## I. What is RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Core Concepts of RAG\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technical framework that combines \"information retrieval\" with \"Large Language Models (LLMs)\". Simply put:\n",
    "- It enables large models to \"consult materials\" first (retrieve relevant information from your knowledge base) before answering questions\n",
    "- Then generate answers based on the retrieved materials to avoid \"fabrication\" (reduce hallucinations)\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://ai-studio-static-online.cdn.bcebos.com/c41c00052949463692fe89f05751e26bb08bf0d1bce74d76889a1958b7baa954)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Core Problems Solved by RAG\n",
    "Three major pain points of traditional large models addressed by RAG:\n",
    "- **Outdated knowledge**: Model training data has an expiration date, while RAG can access the latest knowledge in real-time\n",
    "- **Hallucination generation**: Models may fabricate incorrect information, but RAG grounds answers in real materials\n",
    "- **Domain limitations**: General models lack sufficient expertise in specialized fields, while RAG can connect to industry knowledge bases\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://ai-studio-static-online.cdn.bcebos.com/091ca1c290fd479da526488c6a400c262c902e01c8bc4314bb1a1521eb6b507f)\n",

    "    A[User Query] --> B[Query Parsing]\n",
    "    B --> C[Retrieve from Knowledge Base]\n",
    "    C --> D[Obtain Relevant Documents]\n",
    "    D --> E[Splice into Prompt]\n",
    "    E --> F[LLM Generate Answer]\n",
    "    F --> G[Output Result]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific steps:\n",
    "1. **User Query**: For example, \"What new features does Wenxin Large Model 4.5 have?\"\n",
    "2. **Query Parsing**: Extract keywords \"Wenxin Large Model 4.5\" and \"new features\"\n",
    "3. **Retrieve from Knowledge Base**: Find content about Wenxin 4.5 in your documents\n",
    "4. **Obtain Relevant Documents**: Return 2-3 most relevant descriptions\n",
    "5. **Generate Prompt**: Combine the query and relevant documents into a prompt (e.g., \"Answer based on the following content: [Documents] Question: ...\")\n",
    "6. **Model Generation**: Locally deployed ERNIE-4.5-21B-A3B model generates answer based on the prompt\n",
    "7. **Output Result**: Return answer with supporting references\n",

    "## III. Core Components of RAG Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Three Core Modules\n",
    "1. **Knowledge Base**: Your private materials (documents, web pages, conversation records, etc.)\n",
    "2. **Retriever**: Quickly finds content related to the query from the knowledge base (key component is the \"vector database\")\n",
    "3. **Generator**: Locally deployed ERNIE-4.5-21B-A3B model (generates answers based on retrieved content)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 What is a Vector Database?\n",
    "- Converts text into \"numerical vectors\" (similar to \"mathematical fingerprints\" of text)\n",
    "- The more semantically similar two texts are, the closer their vector distance\n",

      "\r\n",
      "### Core Strategies and Techniques for Werewolf Gameplay\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "1. **Round Pressure Response Table**  \r\n",
      "   - **3 werewolves**: Aggressively fake identity, quickly compress the information space of good players, confuse the good camp through frequent speeches or misleading information.  \r\n",
      "   - **2 werewolves**: 1 werewolf feigns allegiance + 1 werewolf hides deeply. The feigning werewolf pretends to be a good player to vote out key special roles, while the deep-hiding werewolf waits for the right moment.  \r\n",
      "   - **1 werewolf**: Hide completely, exploit logical loopholes of good players to vote out key special roles (such as seer, witch), avoid early exposure.  \r\n",
      "   *Source: Reference 3 (Werewolf Gameplay.txt)*\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "2. **Advanced Thinking Models**  \r\n",
      "   - **Reverse Thinking Deduction**: Assume you are a good player, build logical chains to ensure consistent speeches, predict and interfere with the real seer's inspection path.  \r\n",
      "   - **Bayesian Probability Calculation**: Dynamically estimate the success rate of eliminating all gods or all villagers based on the number of survivors (e.g., with 4 villagers, 2 gods, and 1 werewolf remaining, 3 kills are needed to eliminate all villagers, 2 kills to eliminate all gods).  \r\n",
      "   - **Information Pollution Techniques**:  \r\n",
      "     - **False Alliance Relationships**: Deliberately protect a good player (e.g., \"Player X is definitely good, I guarantee it\"), luring the witch to suspect X.  \r\n",
      "     - **Timeline Tampering**: Fabricate night information (e.g., \"If I were the witch, I would have poisoned Player Y last night\"), implying Y may pose a poisoning threat.  \r\n",
      "   *Source: Reference 3 (Werewolf Gameplay.txt)*\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "3. **Taboos and Fault-Tolerance Mechanisms**  \r\n",
      "   - **Absolutely Forbidden Behaviors**:  \r\n",
      "     - Night killing violates priorities (e.g., killing a villager in the endgame while missing the hunter).  \r\n",
      "     - Faking as seer but falsely accusing the real seer.  \r\n",
      "     - Feigning werewolf exposing too early leading to team collapse.  \r\n",
      "   - **Fault-Tolerance Repair Solutions**:  \r\n",
      "     - **Killing a guarded target**: Claim the witch used a potion the next day to divert attention.  \r\n",
      "     - **Fake identity exposed**: Other werewolves immediately feign allegiance, accusing the exposed one of \"werewolf framing\".  \r\n",
      "     - **Accidentally killing a key special role**: Fabricate a logical chain in the last words to frame them as a \"self-killing werewolf\".  \r\n",
      "   *Source: Reference 3 (Werewolf Gameplay.txt)*\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "4. **Practical Case Library**  \r\n",
      "   - **Self-kill + Feigned Allegiance Combination**:  \r\n",
      "     - Werewolf A self-kills on the first night, witch saves them → Werewolf B fakes identity and confirms Werewolf A as good during the day → Real seer inspects Werewolf A and confirms as werewolf → Werewolf C feigns allegiance to the real seer, ultimately framing the real seer as a werewolf.  \r\n",
      "   - **Endgame Balanced Faction Elimination**:  \r\n",
      "     - 1 werewolf (Werewolf D), 1 hunter, 2 villagers remaining → Werewolf D votes out a villager during the day, kills the hunter at night, triggering victory by eliminating all villagers.  \r\n",
      "   *Source: Reference 3 (Werewolf Gameplay.txt)*\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "### Impact of Hunter Gameplay on Werewolves\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "- **Hunter Disguised as Villager**: Hunters may pretend to be villagers to protect fake seers, luring the werewolf team to kill the real seer, then shoot to take down the fake seer.  \r\n",
      "- **Endgame Double Kill Case**: If the hunter is killed with their ability intact, they can take a werewolf down, securing victory for the good camp.  \r\n",
      "*Source: Reference 1 (Hunter Gameplay.txt)*\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "### Summary\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Werewolf gameplay requires combining round pressure response, advanced thinking models (such as reverse deduction, probability calculation), information pollution techniques, and taboo management. In actual play, flexibly use strategies like self-killing, feigning allegiance, and identity faking, and repair mistakes through fault-tolerance mechanisms. Cases like hunter disguise further reflect the complexity and strategic depth of the werewolf faction.\r\n",

      "✨ Answer: Based on the provided reference materials, the core goal of villager gameplay is to build a multi-dimensional perspective analysis network through information integration and logical modeling, assist special roles in accurately identifying werewolves, while avoiding becoming a round-consuming item. However, the reference materials do not directly provide specific operational strategies or detailed steps for villager gameplay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In Werewolf game, villagers (ordinary players) typically do not have special abilities but can assist special role players (such as seers, witches, hunters, etc.) in reasoning by observing other players' behaviors, speeches, and voting patterns. Here are some general strategies that villager players might adopt:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "1. **Observation and Recording**: Villager players should closely monitor other players' speeches and behaviors, recording any suspicious or abnormal actions. This helps make more accurate judgments in subsequent voting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "2. **Assisting Special Roles**: Villager players can try to establish connections with special role players, providing information or supporting their judgments. For example, if a seer accuses a player, villager players can ask the seer for reasons and attempt to verify the authenticity of this information.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "3. **Avoiding Exposure**: Villager players should try to avoid revealing their identity or stance in the game to prevent becoming targets of the werewolf team. This includes maintaining neutrality in speeches and avoiding overly aggressive remarks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "4. **Rational Voting**: During voting, villager players should vote based on observed information and logical reasoning, avoiding blind following or impulsive voting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "5. **Team Cooperation**: Villager players should maintain close cooperation with other good players to jointly counter the werewolf team. This includes sharing information and supporting each other during the game.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It should be noted that the above strategies are derived from the general rules and logical reasoning of Werewolf game, and are not specific operation guides for villager gameplay. Since the reference materials do not provide specific strategies for villager gameplay, the above answer is only a general suggestion.\r\n",

    "## VI. Industry Application Scenarios of RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 Enterprise Customer Service\n",
    "- Use RAG to connect product manuals and after-sales procedures, enabling customer service robots to call up the latest materials in real-time to answer user questions, reducing manual intervention\n",
    "- **Localization advantage**: Enterprise data never leaves the company, ensuring data security\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2 Medical Assistance\n",
    "- Doctors input patient symptoms, RAG retrieves the latest clinical guidelines and cases, assisting doctors in judging possible causes (requires professional review)\n",
    "- **Localization advantage**: Patient privacy data is processed entirely locally\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3 Educational Tutoring\n",
    "- When students ask math questions, RAG finds relevant knowledge points from textbooks and exercise sets, and the large model explains based on textbook content, ensuring synchronization with teaching\n",
    "- **Localization advantage**: Teaching content is controllable, no need to worry about network connection issues\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.4 Legal Retrieval\n",
    "- Lawyers input case details, RAG retrieves relevant laws and precedents, and the large model generates legal analysis, improving retrieval efficiency\n",
    "- **Localization advantage**: Case information remains confidential, meeting data security requirements of the legal industry\n",
    "\n",
    "## VII. Optimization Tips for Beginners\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Text Chunking Optimization**: When splitting long documents, split by \"semantic completeness\" (e.g., by paragraphs) to avoid cutting off sentences\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\n",
    "   text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(\n",
    "       chunk_size=500, \n",
    "       chunk_overlap=50,\n",
    "       separators=[\"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\", \"。\", \"！\", \"？\", \"；\"]\n",
    "   )\n",
    "   chunks = text_splitter.split_text(long_document)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prompt Optimization**: Clearly tell the model to \"only answer based on the provided materials\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Please answer strictly based on the following materials, do not mention information outside the materials. If materials are insufficient, directly say \"Cannot answer this question based on the provided materials\".\n",
    "   Materials: {context}\n",
    "   Question: {question}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the above steps, you have mastered the core logic and complete implementation of the RAG system based on the locally deployed ERNIE-4.5-21B-A3B model. This solution ensures data security (fully localized) while providing powerful knowledge question-answering capabilities, making it an ideal choice for enterprise-level RAG applications."
