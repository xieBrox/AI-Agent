> A practical project collection for ERNIE large language model applications, covering medical AI agents, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multimodal model deployment, and invoice automation.

## üåü Project Overview

This repository focuses on **ERNIE large language model application development**, providing four end-to-end practical projects to help developers master ERNIE's implementation in real-world scenarios. Leveraging ERNIE's strengths in Chinese understanding, multimodal processing, and knowledge integration, these projects demonstrate how to build intelligent systems with industrial value.

### üéØ What You'll Learn
- **Multimodal Applications**: Processing text and image inputs for medical scenarios
- **Knowledge Enhancement**: Building retrieval-augmented generation systems with vector databases
- **Local Deployment**: Deploying ERNIE-4.5-VL (Vision-Language) model for offline use
- **OCR + LLM Integration**: Automating invoice processing with PPOCR and ERNIE
- **Practical Tools**: Integrating Gradio interfaces, ChromaDB, and multi-agent architectures

## üìÅ Project Collection

### üè• Medical-Agent (`Medical-Agent/`)
An intelligent medical consultation system powered by ERNIE, enabling AI-assisted symptom analysis and health recommendations.

| Core Function | Technical Implementation | Key Features |
|---------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| Symptom Analysis | ERNIE-based NLP, multi-agent architecture | Extracts key symptoms from text descriptions and medical images |
| Risk Assessment | Knowledge retrieval + ERNIE reasoning | Generates 1-5 risk levels and urgency recommendations |
| Treatment Planning | Medical knowledge base integration | Provides examination, medication, and lifestyle suggestions |
| User Interface | Gradio interactive interface | Supports text input and image uploads (e.g., X-rays, skin photos) |

**Key Files**:
- `agents.py`: Multi-agent system (symptom parser, knowledge retriever, diagnosis agent)
- `ernie_client.py`: ERNIE model interaction (text generation, image-text analysis)
- `knowledge_base.py`: Medical knowledge storage and retrieval with ChromaDB
- `main.gradio.py`: User-friendly visual interface


### üîç RAG-Tutorial (`RAG-Tutorial/`)
A step-by-step guide to building retrieval-augmented generation systems with ERNIE, focusing on document processing and knowledge retrieval.

| Core Function | Technical Implementation | Key Features |
|---------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| Document Processing | Intelligent text chunking | Splits documents while preserving semantic integrity (character/token double verification) |
| Knowledge Base Construction | ChromaDB vector database | Supports multiple embedding functions (default, SentenceTransformer) |
| Efficient Retrieval | Similarity search optimization | Batch processing and structured data storage (JSONL format) |
| Augmented Generation | ERNIE + retrieved context | Enhances response accuracy with knowledge grounding |

**Key Files**:
- `document_processor.py`: Text chunking and preprocessing (jieba for tokenization)
- `chroma_builder.py`: Vector database operations (data loading, querying, statistics)
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies for document processing and database management


### üñºÔ∏è ERNIE-4.5-VL Local Deployment (`ERNIE-4.5-VL-Local-Deployment-Tutorial/`)
A comprehensive tutorial for deploying ERNIE-4.5-VL (Vision-Language) model locally, enabling multimodal applications without relying on cloud services.

| Core Function | Technical Implementation | Key Features |
|---------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| Local Service Setup | FastAPI/UVicorn deployment | Establishes RESTful API for model interactions |
| Multimodal Processing | Image-text joint understanding | Supports image input (Base64 encoding) and cross-modal tasks |
| Environment Configuration | Hardware optimization guidance | GPU acceleration and resource management tips |
| Practical Examples | Sample inference code | Demos for image description, visual question answering, etc. |


### üîñ PPOCR-invoice-automation (`PPOCR-invoice-automation/`)
An intelligent invoice processing system integrating PPOCR (Baidu's OCR toolkit) and ERNIE, enabling automated extraction, verification, and structured storage of invoice information.

| Core Function | Technical Implementation | Key Features |
|---------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| Invoice Recognition | PPOCR + image preprocessing | High-precision extraction of text from various invoice types (fapiao, receipt, etc.) |
| Information Structuring | ERNIE-based NLP | Converts unstructured text to structured data (amount, date, payer, item details) |
| Data Validation | Rule engine + ERNIE reasoning | Verifies logical consistency (e.g., amount format, date validity) |
| Batch Processing | Asynchronous task queue | Supports bulk invoice processing with progress tracking |
| Export Function | Multi-format output | Generates Excel/JSON reports for financial systems integration |

**Key Files**:
- `invoice_processor.py`: OCR recognition and text extraction pipeline
- `ernie_validator.py`: ERNIE-based information verification and correction
- `data_exporter.py`: Structured data export to various formats
- `main.py`: Command-line interface for batch processing
